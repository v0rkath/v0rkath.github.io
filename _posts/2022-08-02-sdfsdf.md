## RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)

This is a very commonly used Stream Cipher (this transforms a plaintext string byte-by-byte, they are linear meaning they are a symmetric type of encryption).

Typically has 3 stages:

1.  Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA) `-> Creates a list of scrambled values`
    
    - It is essentially the "initialisation" stage
    - Creates a list of values form 0 to 256
    - Each value is swapped with another based on a calculation (essentially scrambles the list of values)
2.  Pseudo Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA) `-> Creates the Keystream`
    
    - Generates and outputs the Keystream using the list
    - It will generate however many bytes it needs (up to 256)
    - The value '256' or '0x100' is often an easy way to work out that the encryption may be RC4 in assembly.
3.  XOR Operation `-> Encrypts plaintext string`
    
    - It XOR's each byte of the Plaintext with a byte from the Keystream
